# Process Dump
Process Dump is a Windows reverse-engineering command-line tool to dump malware memory components back to disk for analysis. Often malware files are packed and obfuscated before they are executed in order to avoid AV scanners, however when these files are executed they will often unpack or inject a clean version of the malware code in memory. A common task for malware researchers when analyzing malware is to dump this unpacked code back from memory to disk for scanning with AV products or for analysis with static analysis tools such as IDA.

Process Dump works for Windows 32 and 64 bit operating systems and can dump memory components from specific processes or from all processes currently running. Process Dump supports creation and use of a clean-hash database, so that dumping of all the clean files such as kernel32.dll can be skipped. It's main features include:
* Dumps code from a specific process or all processes
* Finds and dumps hidden modules that are not properly loaded in processes
* Finds and dumps loose code chunks even if they aren't associated with a PE file. It builds a PE header and import table for the chunks.
* Reconstructs imports using an aggressive approach.
* Can run in close dump monitor mode ('-closemon'), where processes will be paused and dumped just before they terminate.
* Multi-threaded, so when you are dumping all running processes it will go pretty quickly.
* Can generate a clean hash database. Generate this before a machine is infected with malware so Process Dump will only dump the new malicious malware components.

I'm maintaining an official compiled release on my website here:

# Example Usage
Dump all modules and hidden code chunks from all processes on your system (ignoring known clean modules):
* pd64.exe -system

Run in terminate monitor mode. Until cancelled (CTRL-C), Process Dump will dump any process just before the termination:
* pd64.exe -closemon

Dump all modules and hidden code chunks from a specific process identifier:
* pd64.exe -pid 0x18A

Dump all modules and hidden code chunk by process name:
* pd64.exe -p .*chrome.*

Build clean-hash database. These hashes will be used to exclude modules from dumping with the above commands:
* pd64.exe -db gen

Dump code from a specific address in PID 0x1a3:
* pd64.exe -pid 0x1a3 -a 0xffb4000
 * Generates two files (32 and 64 bit) that can be loaded for analysis in IDA with generated PE headers and generated import table:
  * notepad_exe_x64_hidden_FFB40000.exe
  * notepad_exe_x86_hidden_FFB40000.exe


# Example sandbox usage
If you are running an automated sandbox or manual anti-malware research environment, I recommend running the following process with Process Dump, run all commands as Administrator:
1. On your clean environement build the clean hash database.
 * pd64.exe -db gen
 * (or more quickly) pd64 -db genquick
2. Begin the Process Dump terminate monitor. This will dump all the intermediate processes used by the malware:
 * pd64.exe -closemon
3. Run the malware file
4. Watch the malware install (and pd64 dumping any process that tries to close)
5. When you are ready to dump the running malware from memory, run the following command to dump all processes:
 * pd64.exe -system
6. All the dumped components will be in the working directory of pd64.exe. You can change the output path using the '-o' flag,


Notes on the naming convention of dumped modules:
* 'hiddemodule' in the filename instead of the module name indicates the module was not properly registered in the process.
* 'codechunk' in the filename means that it is a reconstructed dump from a loose executable region. This can be for example injected code that did not have a PE header. Codechunks will be dumped twice, once with a reconstructed x86 and again with a reconstructed x64 header.

Example filenames of dumped files
* notepad_exe_PID2990_hiddenmodule_16B8ABB0000_x86.dll
* notepad_exe_PID3b5c_notepad.exe_7FF6E6630000_x64.exe
* notepad_exe_PID2c54_codechunk_17BD0000_x86.dll
* notepad_exe_PID2c54_codechunk_17BD0000_x64.dll

Process Dump (pd.exe) is a tool used to dump both 32 and 64 bit executable modules
back to disk from memory within a process address space. This tool is able to find
and dump hidden modules, and it uses a clean hash database to exclude dumping of
known clean files. This tool uses an aggressive import reconstruction approach that
links all DWORD/QWORDs that point to an export in the process to the corresponding
export function.

Before first usage of this tool, when on the clean workstation the clean exclusing
hash database can be generated by either:
  pd -db gen
  pd -db genquick

Example Usage:
  pd -system
  pd -p chrome.exe
  pd -p "(?i).*chrome.*"
  pd -pid 419
  pd -pid 0x1a3
  pd -pid 0x1a3 -a 0x401000

Options:
  -pid (pid)  Dumps all modules not matching the clean hash database
      from the specified pid into the current working
      directory. Use a '0x' prefix to specify a hex PID.

  -p (regex)  Dumps all modules not matching the clean hash database
      from the process name found to match the filter into
      specified pid into the current working directory.

  -system   Dumps all modules not matching the clean hash database
      from all accessible processes into the working
      directory.

  -g    Forces generation of PE headers from scratch, ignoring existing headers.

  -v    Verbose.

  -nh   No header is printed in the output.

  -nr   Disable recursion on hash database directory add or
      remove commands.

  -ni   Disable import reconstruction.

  -db gen   Automatically processes a few common folders as well as
      all the currently running processes and adds the found
      module hashes to the clean hash database. It will add
      all files recursively in: 
        %WINDIR% 
        %HOMEPATH% 
        C:\Program Files\ 
        C:\Program Files (x86)\ 
      As well as all modules in all running processes 

  -db genquick  Adds the hashes from all modules in all processes to
      the clean hash database. Run this on a clean system.

  -db add (dir) Adds all the files in the specified directory
      recursively to the clean hash database. 

  -db rem (dir) Removes all the files in the specified directory
      recursively from the clean hash database. 

  -db clean Clears the clean hash database.

  -db ignore  Ignores the clean hash database when dumping a process
      this time.  All modules will be dumped even if a match
      is found.
